# Michigan State University / West Virginia University: Facial Makeup Datasets

Available to researchers under the CITeR Database Release Agreement.

Four datasets of female face images assembled for studying the impact of makeup on face recognition

- YMU (YouTube Makeup): face images of subjects were obtained from YouTube video makeup
  tutorials.
- VMU (Virtual Makeup): face images of Caucasian female subjects in the [FRGC Repository](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/frgc.cfm) were synthetically modified to simulate the application of makeup. A publicly available software (www.taaz.com) was used to perform this alteration.
- MIW (Makeup in the &quot;wild&quot;): face images of subjects with and without makeup were obtained from the internet.
- MIFS (Makeup Induced Face Spoofing): face images of subjects were obtained from YouTube video makeup tutorials and face images of associated target subjects from the internet.
