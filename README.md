Michigan State University / West Virginia University: Facial Makeup Datasets
Available to researchers under the CITeR Database Release Agreement.

Four datasets of female face images assembled for studying the impact of makeup on face recognition

YMU (YouTube Makeup): face images of subjects were obtained from YouTube video makeup tutorials.
VMU (Virtual Makeup): face images of Caucasian female subjects in the FRGC Repository were synthetically modified to simulate the application of makeup. A publicly available software (www.taaz.com) was used to perform this alteration.
MIW (Makeup in the "wild"): face images of subjects with and without makeup were obtained from the internet.
MIFS (Makeup Induced Face Spoofing): face images of subjects were obtained from YouTube video makeup tutorials and face images of associated target subjects from the internet.
